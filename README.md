# TypeScript The Right Way

Helping developers author high-quality TypeScript code.

See [tstherightway.com](http://tstherightway.com/).

We aim to teach front-end developers what to avoid and which habits to cultivate when creating websites and apps using Typescript.

## Principles

1. **Informative**: Provides explanations and examples
1. **Efficient**: As short and simple as possible
1. **Opinionated**: Recommends most appropriate options
1. **Non-introductory**: Doesn't teach the language
1. **Non-redundant**: Doesn't cover anything that's explained better elsewhere
1. **Transparent**: Provides reasoning
1. **Community-powered**: Anyone can contribute
1. **Evolving**: Always changing, never finished
